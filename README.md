Tuono (Italian word for "thunder", pronounced /2 Oh No/). 
Why Tuono? Just a badass name.

## Introduction

NodeJs/Deno/Bun are the only tools that make a React app fullstack right? (TLDR; no) 

Techically the only thing React needs to do on the backend side is to render the HTML and returns it in the response payload and for it just a JS engine is required. 
Why then we need to bring the entire runtime?

Tuono wants to prove that it's possible creating fully fledged react applications without the need to host them on a JS runtime server leveraging the best of the two worlds: 
super powered server and crazy cool development experience.
