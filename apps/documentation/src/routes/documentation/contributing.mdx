# How to contribute

## TL;DR

The project is massive - if you like it do consider to contribute!

## Getting started

Currently I'm keeping a private dashboard to prioritize new features and bug fixes.

If you want to propose something please open a new issue on github or reach me using
my email address [valerioageno@yahoo.it](mailto:valerioageno@yahoo.it).
I'm also available on twitter (X) DMs `@valerioageno`, [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerioageno)
and discord `@__v__v__`.

## Requirements

To contribute is not strictly required to know both typescript and rust (even though it
would be a great nice to have). Most of the feature tasks and bugfixes can be handled solely on
the client or on the server side.
