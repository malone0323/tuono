# Tuono

**Tuono is a fullstack framework for building React applications using Rust as
backend.**

Tuono (Italian word for "thunder", pronounced /2 Oh No/). Why Tuono? Just a badass name.

## Introduction

**NodeJs/Deno/Bun are the only runtimes that allow a React app to be fullstack right? (no)**

Tuono is a fullstack React framework with the server side written in Rust. 
Because of this Tuono is extremely fast and the requests are handled by multithreaded Rust server. 
React is still React - it is just superpowered.

**Rust is an hard language then writing server side code is hard as well right? (no again)**

Tuono provides a collection of utilities to handle the server side code seamlessly with 
the React code. Each server side route is managed with a separate file alongside the React route.
The routing is handled by Tuono based on the files defined within the `./src/routes` directory.
