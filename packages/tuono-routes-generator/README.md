# Router generator

This package handle the creation of the routes.
Basically collects and manages them in a single entry point file.

## Generated route file

Currently the generator file is very similar to `@tanstack/router` one but since it does not need the same
configurability is up to strong updates.

```tsx
// This file is auto-generated by Tuono

import { Route as rootRoute } from './routes/__root'
import { Route as AboutImport } from './routes/about'
import { Route as IndexImport } from './routes/index'

// Create/Update Routes

const AboutRoute = AboutImport.update({
  path: '/about',
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
} as any)

const IndexRoute = IndexImport.update({
  path: '/',
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
} as any)

// Populate the FileRoutesByPath interface

declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
  interface FileRoutesByPath {
    '/': {
      preLoaderRoute: typeof IndexImport
      parentRoute: typeof rootRoute
    }
    '/about': {
      preLoaderRoute: typeof AboutImport
      parentRoute: typeof rootRoute
    }
  }
}

// Create and export the route tree

export const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([IndexRoute, AboutRoute])
```
